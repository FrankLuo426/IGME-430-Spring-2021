# Week 4 Notes (2/15/21,2/17/21)

## I. Review

- Streaming Media HW
- [Skill #11 - Creating CommonJS Code Modules](../core-skills/11-creating-commonjs-code-modules.md):
  - moved code into multiple modules
  - isn't that *dispatch table* a lot better than a bunch of `if(){}else{..` statements?!
  - but can you think of an even *better way*, so that the developer doesn't have to hard-code every file name?

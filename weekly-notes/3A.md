# Week 3A Notes (2/8/21)

## I. Overview

- Questions on *Simple HTTP HW*
  - what was "new":
    - creating your own modules with `require()` & `module.exports`
      - let's look at another way to write `module.exports`
    - the `fs` module and `readFileSync()` for loading static files:
      - our demos/Core Skills have been hard-coding the HTML files - LAME!
  - other concepts:
    - the main "request handler" function for the `.onRequest()`
      - note that 2 parameters are aways sent along - `request` and `response`
    - `npm test`
- Upcoming HW Assignments:
  - [Skill #10 - Debugging Node](../core-skills/10-debugging-node.md) - due tonight - super easy - let's run though it:
    - `node --inspect ./src/index.js`
    - chrome://inspect
    - test it out
    - let's also create a "chromeinspect" key in "scripts"
    - the purpose of this assignment is to teach you how to do common debugging acivities in Node - you need to have theis skill in your personal developer toolbox!
  - [Random Joke with tooling - checkoff](../checkoff-notes/random-joke-with-tooling-checkoff.md) - super easy - due tomorrow night:
    - has you adding `nodemon`, `eslint` (code validation), and *continuous integration* (CircleCI) to your random-joke web service
    - the purpose of this assignment is to review how to install these developer dependencies to your project
    - also, we will be assigning Project 1 next week, and you are going to be substantially upgrading *Random Joke* so that it will be a great Project 1 "starter"
  - [Skill #11 - Creating CommonJS Code Modules](../core-skills/11-creating-commonjs-code-modules.md) - due Wednesday night:
    - this walks through how to refactor the "Random Number" HW to create external modules (**htmlResponses.js** & **jsonResponses.js**)

## I. Overview

- Any questions?
- Review recent HW

## II. Homework

- [CS #4 - "Hello Node"](../core-skills/4-hello-node.md)
  - Review *What is Node.js?*
  - "Hello Node"
  - Creating Node projects:
    - two ways to create a **package.json** file:
      - `npm init`
      - `npm init -y`
    - some edits we did:
      - `"scripts":"start"`
      - "Bad" JSON in the **package.json** file? What's the error message?
     - Utilizing node packages (i.e. "libraries")
       - `npm install <package-name> --save`
       - `npm i <package-name>` // quicker!
     - Reinstalling packages after **node_modules** folder has been deleted
       - `npm install` or just `npm i` 
   - Review HW questions
- [CS #5 - "First Node Web Server"](../core-skills/5-first-node-web-server.md)
  - Your first web server, deployed to Heroku

    - The `onRequest()` handler:
      - note how much control we have over what gets sent to the clinet:
        - we can send HTTP respons headers, status codes, and then the actual content

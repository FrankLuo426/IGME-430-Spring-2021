# Project 1 - API Powered App - DRAFT

##  I. Overview

Individually, you need to make a rich web app that uses a web API of your design. You may use an external API in addition to your own. The app should be engaging and aesthetically pleasing. Ideally these will all be portfolio quality. The project should be scoped for just a couple weeks.

Application: The actual project is fairly open-ended. The goal is to make a rich web app that uses backend (server) data from an API. The app should be aesthetically pleasing and provide a rich user experience. The static files (like HTML, CSS, Client JS, images, etc) may be sent normally, but the rest of the changes/updates for the app should be done through a custom AJAX API.

You may opt to do a shared image pinning system (like an all public Pinterest) or perhaps a visualized message system (like this).

Regardless of the application, your project should be appropriately scoped for a couple weeks. This means different levels of scope depending on the type of application. Please understand that these cannot have a larger scope or else you will not have enough time. 80% of the development will be done in 20% of the time. Actually completing the project with a passing grade will take a majority of the time.

## II. Ideas

Here are some loose ideas that would warrant a server side API. Be creative! Make a good portfolio piece!

- https://www.pokedex.org/ (loads page with overall list, but then calls to an individual one when clicked. Your API should work directly from the URL returning JSON.)
- https://naramsim.github.io/Colosseum/ (similar to above, with individual calls to certain objects. Note: this app uses a hash reference in the URL instead of query parameters, which does not quite fit the requirements. The overall app itself is similar to the idea of the assignment though.)
- https://sii.im/playground/notes/ (Note system where users can create a note and then use a query parameter through some UI ability or unique url to recall that particular note. Then the user could edit their note again.)
- https://trello.com/ (similar to above, a shared task board people could add tasks to or update.)
- https://asana.com (Similar to Trello. A task board people can add tasks to or update.)
- https://www.meetup.com (App for creating meetups based on a topic, area and time.)
- https://www.pinterest.com/ (board or boards people could add images, text, keywords to and add more later. To avoid uploading images, the user could submit a URL instead).
- https://deanhume.github.io/beer/ (App indexing some topic, such as board games, heartstone cards, music, etc and letting the user click on individuals for more info, go through categories or even search).
- https://hellosunapp.com (App that shows positions of the sun and moon in different times zones throughout the world.)
- https://getkana.com/app/ (Another tutorial type app that users could add to).
- http://flateric.columba.uberspace.de/canvas/ (Visualization of user collected messages, links, etc).
- http://idiots.win/ (quiz type app users could add questions to or create their own unique quiz).
- https://www.google.com/forms/about (A survey & survey creation system.)
- https://www.instapaper.com (A link and article manager. For users to store links for later.)
- https://www.getpennies.com (A personal financial tracker. Users can add their own data. DO NOT COLLECT REAL USER FINANICAL DATA IN THIS COURSE.)
